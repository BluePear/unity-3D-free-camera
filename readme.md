Do NOT attach this script directly to the camera.

Attach this script to an empty GameObject, whose y-position is 0. Then make the camera a child of this GameObject.

- WASD pans the camera.
- Q,E and holding right mouse button rotates the camera around the y axis.
- Middle mouse click drags the world.
- Mouse wheel zooms.
- Rotation around the x and z axes is not implemented.
